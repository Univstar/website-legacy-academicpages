I am currently a PhD student at [Center on Frontiers of Computing Studies (CFCS)](http://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/) in [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Baoquan Chen](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/baoquan/), and an intern at [Advanced Innovation Center for Future Visual Entertainment (AICFVE)](http://fve.bfa.edu.cn/) in [Beijing Film Academy](http://www.bfa.edu.cn/), advised by [Dr. Bin Wang](https://binwangbfa.github.io/). My research interests lie in computer graphics and computational physics. In particular, I devote myself to physical simulation and physically based rendering.

I graduated from Turing Class, Peking University in July 2020 and earned dual bachelor's degrees in computer science and physics.
